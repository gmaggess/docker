Webpack Manifest Plugin\n\nWebpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin)\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your `webpack.config.js`\n\n```javascript\nvar ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    // ...\n    plugins: [\n      new ManifestPlugin()\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nThis will generate a `manifest.json` file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mods/alpha.js\": \"mods/alpha.1234567890.js\",\n  \"mods/omega.js\": \"mods/omega.0987654321.js\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nA manifest is configurable using constructor options:\n\n```javascript\nnew ManifestPlugin({\n  fileName: 'my-manifest.json',\n  basePath: '/app/'\n})\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n* `fileName`: The manifest filename in your output directory (`manifest.json` by default).\n* `basePath`: A path prefix for all file references. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.\n* `publicPath`: A path prefix used only on output files, similar to Webpack's  [output.publicPath](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/configuration#outputpublicpath). Ignored if `basePath` was also provided.\n* `stripSrc`: removes unwanted strings from source filenames\n* `writeToFileEmit`: If set to `true` will emit to build folder and memory in combination with `webpack-dev-server`   \n* `cache`: In [multi-compiler mode](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler) webpack will overwrite the manifest on each compilation. Passing a shared `{}` as the `cache` option into each compilation's ManifestPlugin will combine the manifest between compilations.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"danethurber","email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-18T23:06:28.803Z","created":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-21T21:00:37.797Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-07T23:11:34.573Z","0.3.0":"2015-07-02T14:20:18.411Z","0.4.0":"2015-08-06T21:12:09.881Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-31T14:18:07.275Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-07T16:55:53.554Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-26T02:33:18.022Z","1.1.0-0":"2016-10-19T15:26:15.276Z","1.1.0":"2016-10-19T15:36:52.850Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Dane Thurber","email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"qbylucky":true,"ackhub":true,"cognivator":true,"detj":true,"jcurtis":true,"gabrielschlomo":true,"sqrtthree":true,"xu_q90":true,"arkanciscan":true,"bourne":true,"zhilidali":true,"fengmiaosen":true,"landy2014":true,"bro_strummer":true,"martinspinks":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"591e28f4-3e88\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 18 May 2017 23:06:28 GMT"}
